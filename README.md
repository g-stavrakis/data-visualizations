## About this project

In this repository there are 3 static visualizations that presented the impact of the pandemic on business foundation patterns. More specifically, the analysis examines the effects of the 3 lockdowns on companies incorporated in United Kingdom. 

1. The first graph illustrates how the 3 lockdowns affect the number of companies incorporated from January 2018 until November 2021 along with the fluctuation of the basic categories of incorporations. 
2. The second graph displays the effect of the lockdowns in the 22 sectors in UK. In order to capture this effect the monthly percentage change of each sector was taken and ordered based on that change. 
3. The third graph shows the allocation of newly formed companies in 10 areas the months without and during lockdowns in the period 2018-2021.
